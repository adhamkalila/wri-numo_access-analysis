# All Possible Commutes
This repository contains scripts and datasets from the study conducted by [Transport for Cairo (TfC)](https://transportforcairo.com/) and the [New Urban Mobility Alliance (NUMO)](https://www.numo.global/). 
<!-- The published study can be found [here]() - TODO: ADD LINK WHEN STUDY IS PUBLISHED --> 
 
 ## Repository Overview
 
 The repository is organised into the following folders. 
 ### code
Scripts and edited software tools that comprises the data pipeline enabling accessibility modeling as per our methodology. Pipeline sequence is as follows:
1. **Pre-processing**: Set of scripts to download and process data from online sources and prepare datasets for analysis.
2. **pbf_augmenter**: Python script that embeds road segment speed data into an OSM PBF road network. More details on this process can be found in the section on [editing osm pbf files](#editing-osm-pbf-files).
3. **Analysis**: Scripts used for calculating travel time matrices and accessibility measures. More details on this process can be found in the section on [micromobility and accessibility](#micromobility-and-accessibility).
4. **Equity**: These scripts are for the equity analysis conducted for the cities of San Francisco and Minneapolis

## Editing OSM pbf files

To add traffic data onto road network segments, we need to edit the OSM pbf file that r5 uses to build the routable graph. There is a discussion in r5r about enabling this functionality, but it is still a work in progress (link). 

Each segment in the speed datasets is labelled with an OSM way ID which can be matched to the way IDs from a recent download of the OSM road network. This underlines the operability of the speed datasets because OSM networks are consumed by many routing engines.  The script written for this task takes in the road network in .osm format, matches the real speed observed on each way or partial way, and adds a maxspeed tag with the real speed to the copied ways or partial ways. This is because the r5 routing engine uses the maxspeed tag to calculate travel times on roads if they are present. If a maxspeed tag is not available for a road, r5 uses a default based on the road type. The data is matched to the latest OSM build of the road network to create an updated PBF file. 
 


@ ADHAM - can you (a) edit and elaborate on the method below, and (b) point to specific scripts / even lines of code from our open github repo :

* Convert pbf file to xml
  - What package did you use?
* Use the xml.etree.EleentTree python module to query the xml file
  - Replace maxspeed:car values with values from Uber data
  - Elaborate on logic
* Convert xml to pbf
  - package?


## Micromobility and accessibility

The capabilities of open-source routing engines to model micromobility are a recent development. A standard for micromobility data [(GBFS â€“ General Bikeshare Feed Specification)](https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs) has been widely adopted only in the past few years. This standard makes (real-time) micromobility data feeds available through an API, and support for it has been added to OpenTripPlanner [link](https://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/v2.0.0/Configuration/#gbfs-configuration). While it is useful for trip planning purposes, a live API does not give us the flexibility required for analysing accessibility or for modeling scenarios.   

### Approach 

Our proposed approach uses GBFS feeds to obtain the geographic scope of micromobility services, and then uses cycling as a proxy for micromobility when calculating travel times for multimodal trips. The logic is as follows: 
1. Create a variable hexagon grid over the study area (using [this script](https://github.com/transportforcairo/wri-numo_access-analysis/blob/main/code/1_Preprocessing/2.0_variable_hexgrid.R))
2. Identify locations of micromobility (using [this script](https://github.com/transportforcairo/wri-numo_access-analysis/blob/main/code/1_Preprocessing/1_extract-get_gbfs.R))
   - Docked: station locations 
   - Dockless: service area 
3. For each zone (grid unit), determine whether it is served by micromobility or not (using [this script](https://github.com/transportforcairo/wri-numo_access-analysis/blob/main/code/1_Preprocessing/2.3_transform-gbfs2zones.R))
4. Determine travel time between each zone, i.e., OD-pair, using availability of micromobility to determine possible intermodality. Cycling is used as a proxy for micromobility when specifying modes in the routing engine. We create multiple travel time matrices using different mode combinations (see Table 1) . This is done using [this script](https://github.com/transportforcairo/wri-numo_access-analysis/blob/main/code/3_Analysis/3.1_analysis-travel_time_r5.R))
5. Use results from steps 3 and 4 to get travel time using micromobility for each OD pair. The travel times are based on the availability of micromobility, as shown in the table below. This is done using [this script](https://github.com/transportforcairo/wri-numo_access-analysis/blob/main/code/3_Analysis/3.2_analysis-travel_time_scenarios.R)).
